## ASMODEE runs

This section contains links to *asmodee* results for each WHO region.
Results are stored as *rds* files, each containing a `list` with the
following items:

  - `summary`: summary of the ASMODEE results
  - `results`: outputs of ASMODEE
  - `plot_overall_deaths`: *ggplot2* object of the overall dynamics plot
    using death per capita on the y-axis
  - `plot_overall_peaks`: *ggplot2* object of the overall dynamics plot
    using incidence as percentage of historical peak (excluding the last
    90 days) on the y-axis

Links to the *rds* files:
