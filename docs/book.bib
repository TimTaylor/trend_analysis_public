  title    = "A new look at the statistical model identification",
  author   = "Akaike, H",
  abstract = "The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing
              in time series analysis is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out
              that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately defined
              as the procedure for statistical model identification. The
              classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and
              a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC)
              estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical
              identification is introduced. When there are several competing
              models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum
              likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of
              AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of
              independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE
              provides a versatile procedure for statistical model
              identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the
              application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The
              practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is
              demonstrated with some numerical examples.",
