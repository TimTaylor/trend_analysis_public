# Overview of the reports {#reports}

This chapter provides some additional informations about the different
*Rmarkdown* reports. For details of data processing and analyses, we refer to
the respective documents, as we attempted to document all code in each
report. We recommend compiling the reports first and looking at the *html*
outputs generated as a more user-friendly alternative to inspecting the source
code directly.

Reports can be **compiled** by two ways:

1. using `reportfactory::compile_reports(...)` where `...` is a character string
  matching the name(s) of the reports to be processed (regular expression
  accepted); outputs will be stored in time-stamped folders inside *outputs/*

2. using the usual `rmarkdown::render(...)` where `...` is the path of the `Rmd`
  document to process; outputs will be stored inside *report_sources/*

Some reports accept **parameters**, i.e. variables set at compilation time which can
impact the results generated. This is typically used, for instance, to indicate
which WHO region the analyses are to be performed on, and is a more sustainable
alternative to handling separate reports for every region. The way to specify
parameters is the same in both methods of compilation, and are passed as a list
called `param` when compiling documents. For instance:

```{r eval = FALSE}

library(reportfactory)
compile_reports(report = "analyses",
                params = list(who_region = "AFRO")

```

will compile the analysis report *regional_analyses.Rmd* (only match for the
word `"analyses"`) for the AFRO region.

**Default values of parameters** are set in the YAML headers of the respective
reports.






## Data preparation: *assemble_data.Rmd*

This report download the data and pre-processes it to enable further analyses.
