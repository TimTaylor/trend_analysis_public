# Getting started {#getting-started}

In this chapter, we provide an overview of the folders and files making up this
infrastructure, and guidelines for using it locally.


## Overview of the infrastructure

The data infrastructure is a
[*reportfactory*](https://www.reconverse.org/reportfactory/), which provides a
structure for storing data, auxiliary scripts, reports sources and their
outputs. The main components are:

* *data/*: a folder where raw and clean data are stored; the content of this
  folder is not stored on github to minimize the size of the git archive

* *report_sources/*: a folder containing the sources of the `Rmd` reports doing
  the data gathering and cleaning, and all analyses

* *scripts/*: a folder containing `R` scripts used in the various reports; this
  includes small helper functions to load the latest versions of the data, help
  with bits of analysis, and code for installing packages not on CRAN, which
  cannot be handled automatically by `reportfactory::install_deps()`

* *outputs/*: a folder containing all compiled reports and associated outputs,
  in timestamped folders; this content is automatically generated when using
  `reportfactory::compile_reports()`, and is only stored locally (i.e. on your
  machine), and not on github (to keep the git archive to a minimal size)
  
* *css/*: a folder containing styling for the reports

* *asmodee_outputs:* a folder containing outputs of the main analysis, shared on
  github; this includes images (pinplots and tadpoles), **R** objects (`rds`
  files) containing re-usable analysis results (e.g. for inclusion in websites
  or dashboards), and analysis notes (indicating excluded countries, and reasons
  for their exclusions)
  
* *docs/*: a folder containing the sources and compiled versions of this
  handbook

Other useful files to know of include:

* *README.Rmd*: the source of the `README.md` file, which is displayed on the
  landing package of the [github project](https://github.com/whocov/trend_analysis_public), 
  and shows the latest tadpoles figures by WHO region and also provides links to
  the corresponding `rds` files

* *run_factory.R*: the main R script used in github actions to automate the
  generation of analysis reports for every WHO regions
  
* *run_synthesis.R*: an R script used in github actions to generate a synthesis
  report for all countries, including a classification into levels of risk based
  on incidence, growth and trend acceleration, and sending an email to list of
  recipients with these documents attached
